<h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to Augusta Levy Learning Center!</h2>
<h3>Our Learning Approach</h3>
<p>At Augusta Levy we have two current learning programs and use Applied Behavior Analysis Techniques. ABA is an approach teaching small, measurable units of behavior. This can be a little as eye contact to something more complex like communication and social interactions. Through one-on-one intruction and some positive reinforcement from our teachers, these skills are broken into small steps. We also have classes and workshops for parents to learn alongside their child. We believe they are eesential to a child's educational journey.</p>
<h4>Early Intervention Program</h4>
<p>The Early Intervention program focuses on using play and positive reinforcement as a building block in learning. Play is essential to a child’s development. It is an all-encompassing activity that helps to develop critical skills such as social, intellectual, emotional and physical abilities. For children with disabilities, these skills are crucial to their development.</p>
<h4>Independence Through Intervention</h4>
<p>The Independence through Intervention program targets giving individuals with autism the life skills to live a safe, happy life of independence. The therapists at ALLC focus on various life skills such as: crossing the street, calling 9-1-1, counting money, making a grocery list, going shopping, obtaining transportation, preparing meals, taking medicine, knowing basic first aid, house keeping, etc.</p>
<p>We have a “mock apartment” set up so that the children can learn to complete the various skills needed to become more independent. The apartment currently has a bed, a refrigerator, a dishwasher, an ironing board, and a bathroom with plans to purchase a washer and dryer in the near future. The children also participate in community outings with their therapists to work on navigating public transportation, communication, learning how to ask for help, building social relationships, learning to read signs, eating at a restaurant, and volunteering. Currently, the children volunteer at Catholic Charities on Wednesdays where they package meals, stock the pantry, etc. Therapists also work on self-advocacy, self-regulation, pursuing interests, communication, etc. while at the Center and while in the community.</p>
